# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Forge Agent 

## Overview 

SOP Forge agent converts any short demonstration video into a clean, production‑ready Standard Operating Procedure. 

It automatically transcribes the footage, detects each procedural step, selects (or generates) clear images, and fills your preferred Markdown template—delivering a numbered, well‑formatted document that's ready for training and shop‑floor distribution. Reviewers can then chat with the agent to merge steps, change tone, or swap visuals, and the SOP is regenerated in seconds—eliminating the manual drudgery of documentation. 

The agent has the following capabilities:

* **Video Analysis**: Ingest a single MP4/MOV (or audio track), create a transcript, and segment the narrative into logical, ordered steps. 
* **Image Selection & Enhancement**: Extract key frames for each step or invoke an image‑generation tool to create or improve illustrations when footage is unclear (stretch goal). 
* **Markdown SOP Drafting**: Populate your template with title, purpose, prerequisites, numbered instructions, embedded images with alt‑text, and an auto‑generated "Troubleshooting / FAQ" section. 
* **Interactive Refinement**: Respond to prompts like "merge steps 2 & 3", "use formal tone", or "replace the image for step 5", and instantly produce an updated document. 
* **Export**: Return a final Markdown file that can be copied, downloaded, or pushed into your content system.
