# Azure AI Foundry Agent Service: Basic Agent Setup with the Bing Search Tool

Use this template as a starting point for creating a basic agent project where you know you will want to create agents with the Grounding with Bing Search tool. For more information, see [Azure AI Services Agents Environment Setup](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/environment-setup).

> **Note:** Deploying the template does not create an agent; it only provisions the necessary resources to get started.


## Getting started

Creating your first agent with Azure AI Foundry Agent Service is a two-step process:

1. **Set up your agent environment.**
2. **Create and configure your agent** using either your preferred SDK or the Azure Foundry Portal.
