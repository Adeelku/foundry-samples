# Azure AI Agent Service: Basic Setup 1RP

## Basic Agent Setup
   

This bicep template provisions required resources for a basic project setup. A new Cognitive Services Account is created, a gpt-4o model is deployed, and a new project is created.

All agents created in this project will automatically use Microsoft managed, multitenant search and storage resources.

### Prerequisites
1. To deploy the template, you must have the following roles:
    * Cognitive Services Contributor or Contributor
    * [This is needed for the workarounds] Owner or Role Based Access Administrator (because we are assigning project SMI the AI Developer Role, wonâ€™t be needed once we fix this)
        * Permission for: Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write 
1. To create your first agent you must have the permissions: Azure AI Developer and Cognitive Services User
